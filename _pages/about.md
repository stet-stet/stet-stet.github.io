I am Jayeon Yi, a first-year PhD Student in Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. I am deeply grateful and fortunate to be working as a research assistant for [Prof. Minje Kim](minjekim.com). My current research focus is to investigate few-shot learning of esoteric speech, audio, and music concepts. My current projects include DNN-based speech codecs -- arguably an extreme (and important!) form of latent represenation learning and manipulation. I hope to be able to work on more ideas as I progress further into my degree!

Previously, I worked as an Applied Scientist Intern at [Amazon, Sunnyvale](https://www.amazon.jobs/content/en/teams/devices-and-services/lab126). Over two summers, I had thankfully been given the chance to work on awesome projects involving speech separation or DNN-based codecs. 
Before this, I worked with [Prof. Hun-Seok Kim](https://kim.engin.umich.edu/) on a project related to video and image compression, during my Master's at the University of Michigan. Even before this, I was a student intern at [Music and Audio Research Group](https://marg.snu.ac.kr/), Seoul National University, under the guidance of Prof. Kyogu Lee. Projects from this period culminated in works in [Speech Declipping](https://stet-stet.github.io/DDD/) and [Music-synced game content generation](https://stet-stet.github.io/goct), respectively presented in ICASSP 2024 and ISMIR 2023 LBD. 

In my free time, I make music for fun. I have experience providing or selling some of my music to labels or games under a pseudonym.
